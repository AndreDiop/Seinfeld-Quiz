# About

Utilizing knowledge of elements of Javascript such as eventlisteners, DOM, getters, setters; I was able to create a timed quiz that presents users with a set of questions that they must complete within a set of time. There will be a time penalty for each wrong answer and at the end of the quiz, user will be given the opportunity to enter their name and score will be entered on a high score list.

## Access

Users will access the page through either the direct link to the deployed application

```bash

or through the Github repository
